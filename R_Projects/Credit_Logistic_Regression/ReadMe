Includes R Studio file with all of my code and some interpretations of beta coefficients. 
Also includes testing of the regression assumptions: 
1) Residuals are linear (Linearity)
2) Residuals follow a normal distribution (Multivariate normality)
3) Residuals have equal (constant) variance (Homoscedasticity)
4) Residuals are uncorrelated (Independence)
5) Little correlation between predictor variables (Little to No multicollinearity)

Includes the dataset which is the xlsx file.
